<h2>Description of Data</h2>
<h3>Grouping</h3>
The data are grouped by "Activity" and then by "Subject". The Activity is the action that the user was completing for the duration of that measurement. The Subject refers to one of the 30 users that participated in this experiment. 

<b>Activity:</b>
<ol>
	<li><b>Walking</b> - The subject was walking.</li>
	<li><b>WalkingUpstairs</b> - The subject was up a set of stairs.</li>
	<li><b>WalkingDownstairs</b> - The subject was walking down a set of stairs.</li>
	<li><b>Sitting</b> - The subject was sitting.</li>
	<li><b>Standing</b> - The subject was standing stationary.</li>
	<li><b>Laying</b> - The subject was laying down.</li>
</ol>

<b>Subject:</b> there were 30 participants in this experiment.
